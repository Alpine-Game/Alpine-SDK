# Alpine SDK
### Purpose:
Alpine SDK is a versatile C# game engine build on the SFML graphics engine. It includes a development API and a level editor, as well as (coming soon) a sprite animator.

### Use:
Alpine SDK is used as a base for game creation, it comes with many tools for building games as well as an easy to use modding api. (Planned) One best features of Alpine is the level editor where you can create cross-platform (or game) maps, inspired by Valve's Source engine's "Hammer" Map Editor.

### Compiling:
As of now the only way documented way of compiling the SDK is by using Jetbrains Rider, it comes with a build configuration. You can only target compile to the x86 architecture.
